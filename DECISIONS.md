# Decisions

This file records repository baseline choices.

## Baseline Model

Repository baselines are additive:

```text
ALL -> ALL-PY -> ALL-PY-SRC -> optional specializations
```

Each layer may add files, checks, workflows, or documentation. Later layers may
also override earlier files when the same filename has a different contract.

| Tier                | Applies to                                      | Adds                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ALL`               | Every repository, any language                  | Hygiene, file-format validation, Markdown/YAML/link checks, shared governance files |
| `ALL-PY`            | Any repository with Python tooling or scripts   | Ruff and Python pre-commit configuration                                            |
| `ALL-PY-SRC`        | Python repositories with a `src/` package       | Pyright and package/docs CI                                                         |
| `ALL-PY-SRC-PYPI`   | Publishable Python packages                     | PyPI release workflows                                                              |
| `ALL-COURSE`        | Course repositories                             | Course-specific ignores and safe defaults                                           |
| `ALL-COURSE-PY-SRC` | Course repositories with Python source packages | Standard course docs, API docs, and course docs config                              |
| `ALL-TS`            | TypeScript repositories                         | TypeScript-specific pre-commit configuration                                        |

## Enforcement Model

Not every baseline check is enforced the same way in every repository.

Research, package, and infrastructure repositories may use stricter commit-time
automation.
Course repositories may keep some checks available as explicit
commands instead of making them pre-commit gates.

This keeps the baseline shared while allowing enforcement
to differ by repository purpose.

## Node Tooling Policy

Node is in the shared baseline because `markdownlint-cli2` runs through
`npx`.

This is acceptable for course repositories because it works well,
the workflow has been understandable in practice without significant issues.

## Markdown Linting Policy

Markdown linting uses `markdownlint-cli2`.

The shared config is: `.markdownlint-cli2.yaml`

Run with: `npx markdownlint-cli2 --fix`

Markdown linting belongs in `ALL` because Markdown appears in
research, package, course, and documentation repositories.

In non-course repositories,
Markdown linting may be enforced through `pre-commit`.

In course repositories, Markdown linting may remain an
ad hoc command rather than a pre-commit gate.

`MD013` remains enabled for authored prose at 100 characters, with exceptions for
headings, tables, and code blocks.
This keeps source Markdown readable without
forcing awkward wrapping where wrapping causes damage.

## Repository Checks

These checks are part of the repository baseline. The enforcement point may
differ by layer.

## Ruff Policy

Use Ruff as the safe Python floor.

## Versioning Policy

These repositories are not production deployment targets.
Use normal `pre-commit` pinned `rev:` values because that is how `pre-commit`
works, and do not treat them as permanent pins.
WHY: exact long-term pinning creates maintenance burden and security lag.

Update with:

```shell
pre-commit autoupdate
```

## Run Policy

`pre-commit` carries the shared commit-time checks
for repositories that use the full pre-commit gate.
Course repositories may document Markdown linting
as a manual command rather than
installing it as a pre-commit hook.

## Template Layer Application

This is an example, and can be expected to evolve.

Overrides package-oriented docs config where needed.               |

## Override Policy

Later layers may override earlier files only when the same filename has a
different contract.
WHY: course repositories and package repositories have different generated
files, docs navigation, and student-facing surfaces.

Do not duplicate files downstream when the shared `ALL` version is correct.

Valid examples:

```text
ALL/.gitignore -> ALL-COURSE/.gitignore
ALL-PY-SRC/zensical.toml.template -> ALL-COURSE-PY-SRC/zensical.toml.template
```

## Course Repository Policy

Course repositories should stay safe.
They may use the same shared config files as research and package repositories,
but should avoid unnecessary commit-time friction.
In course repositories:

- keep Markdown linting available outside pre-commit;
- avoid making Markdown line wrapping too severe;
- keep Ruff as a safe floor;
- avoid strict optional rule families unless the course teaches them;
- keep generated outputs and personalized student files ignored.
